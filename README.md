# Limitations
The best practices templates are designed just for the SAP IBP Excel Add-In. 

# Known Issues

copy/move sheet
Users might want to to copy sheets containing planning views using the Excel copy/move function. For planning view sheets the Excel copy/move is not supported: The IBP add-in will not recognize the sheet and omit it in the Edit View dialog. However, the template admin can copy the empty template sheets from the empty templates attached here - before they are filled with a planning view - and then proceed as with the first sheet with New View > Without Template on Current Sheet.

For more restrictions or known issues have a look at the "HowToUseTemplateVBA.pdf" file that is located in this repository.

# How to obtain support
The best practices templates are provided "as-is" and support may be extended as a courtesy until the code is stable. Any changed code is clearly your responsibility.
