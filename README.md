# Limitations
* Chart in the formula based template only looks at 300 rows and they only work in English.
* The best practices templates are designed just for the SAP IBP Add-In for Microsoft Excel

# Known Issues
copy/move sheet
Users might want to copy sheets containing planning views using the native Excel copy/move function. For planning view sheets the native Excel copy/move is not supported: The IBP Add-In for Microsoft Excel will not recognize the sheet and omit it in the Edit View dialog. However, the template admin can copy the empty template sheets from the empty templates attached here - before they are filled with a planning view - and then proceed as with the first sheet with New View > Without Template on Current Sheet.

For more restrictions or known issues have a look at [SAP note 1790530](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/1790530).

# How to obtain support
Do not rely too heavily on the best practices templates. They are meant as an inspiration and as a stepping stone to get you started.
The best practices planning view templates are provided "as-is", no support is provided.
